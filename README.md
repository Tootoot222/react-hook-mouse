      </li>
      <li>
        Mouse position on screen:
        {displayCoordinates(mouse.position.screen)}
      </li>
      <li>
        Mouse movement:
        {displayCoordinates(mouse.movement)}
      </li>
      <li>
        Left button was pressed:
        {displayFlag(mouse.buttons.left)}
      </li>
      <li>
        Right button was pressed:
        {displayFlag(mouse.buttons.right)}
      </li>
      <li>
        Middle button was pressed:
        {displayFlag(mouse.buttons.middle)}
      </li>
      <li>
        Alt key was pressed:
        {displayFlag(mouse.keyboard.alt)}
      </li>
      <li>
        Ctrl key was pressed:
        {displayFlag(mouse.keyboard.ctrl)}
      </li>
      <li>
        Meta key was pressed:
        {displayFlag(mouse.keyboard.meta)}
      </li>
      <li>
        Shift key was pressed:
        {displayFlag(mouse.keyboard.shift)}
      </li>
    </ul>
  )
}
```

## Caveats

Data in `mouse.keyboard` is alrways read from a `MouseEvent` and therefore it will only get updated on mouse events, not when the keys are actually pressed on the keyboard.
